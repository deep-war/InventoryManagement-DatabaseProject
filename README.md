# Node.js Inventory Management System for a Grocery Store
An inventory management system that a manager can use for a grocery store to view items present in the storeâ€™s inventory. The manager can also add an item to the inventory, update the price for an item and delete an item when the grocery store is not serving an item any more. 

The app also provides an option to track price hikes of more than 5$ per product. This would help in further analysis that could help in preventing price gouging if the price hikes are more than 20$.

The project has a login and registration page for authentication of the manager. The manager needs to register himself before logging into the system.
